Days have passed<br />
But not your thoughts<br />
Is love painful?<br />
Or is pain lovable?<br />
Both are true.. The answer is you!<br />
A selfless selfish you are<br />
Who gave sleepless nights<br />
Some with you.. Some without you!<br />

You made distances seem closer<br />
And long walks shorter!<br />
You turned my nights into days<br />
And days into years!<br />
You came from nowhere<br />
And loved like no one!<br />

Strange but true<br />
I loved the imperfect you!<br />
I liked your smile<br />
And loved your anger!<br />
I spelt your name a hundred times<br />
Only with more love each time!<br />

You defined beauty<br />
In love.. In poems..<br />
Through eyes.. Through words..<br />
With cuddles.. With care!<br />
Isnâ€™t that why you remain special?<br />

I wished to see you smile<br />
And hear your voice forever!<br />
I wished to hold your hand<br />
And look into your eyes forever!<br />
I wished that night never ended!<br />
I wished i was your kanmani forever!<br />
If only my wishes<br />
Never remained as wishes forever!!<br />

Not all raindrops form rainbows..<br />
Not all moments become memories..<br />
Not all wounds turn into happy scars..<br />
They are special and so are you!<br />
Time may do us apart<br />
But you ll always be in my heart!<br />
And yeah.. I love you<br />
In all three tenses!!<br />
