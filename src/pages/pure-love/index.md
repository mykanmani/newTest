Time is a beauty I admire<br />
For she can make a stranger from yesterday<br />
Become the point around which<br />
Your world revolves today!<br />
If the universe could have connected each dot so well to make us what we mean to each other today<br />
Then that is what is Magic!<br />
Everything was so well planned and I’m fortunate to have had you in my arms atleast for the few days I actually did.<br />
With every passing day in<br />
This five years I have only loved you more..<br />
In every hardships we have faced<br />
We have had thousands of reasons to leave<br />
But only one reason to stay<br />
And that is Love!<br />
When you come into the picture frame<br />
The whole world behind zooms out<br />
And my heart is pulled towards only You<br />
Is that why you are called the Center of Attraction?<br />
Out of all things that matter the most<br />
You always will remain the first!<br />
As a fact that sounds like a joke<br />
You are not only the topper of class among fellow humans<br />
But also among living and non-living things!!<br />
When i start thinking what to write about you<br />
I’m never short of words to describe you<br />
Because there is always something new and something more that I want to tell you<br />
But honestly, no words can do justice to what you are to me..<br />
And you know that too!<br />

“Unique” and “special” are my favorite words<br />
The feeling that I get when I think of you is the most unique feel that<br />
I have ever experienced!<br />
And you are always so special..<br />
May be that’s why you are My Favorite!<br />
If life was a fantasy then we will the best fantasy that loved and lived on earth!<br />

Every time I feel your breath<br />
My heart stops a beat<br />
Every time I look at your eyes<br />
I feel alive<br />
Every time I remember you<br />
I remember myself at my best!<br />

I know I didn’t live the most days with You<br />
But the memories we created<br />
Are enough for a lifetime!<br />
Thank you for accepting me as I’m..<br />
Bearing with me when I’m demanding<br />
And Loving me for what I’m with you!!<br />

Happy Birthday My Love!!<br />
