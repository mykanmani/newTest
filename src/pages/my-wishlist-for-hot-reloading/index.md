when time is bleeding and we are clueless about each other,

when we realise what we were searching for is each other,

when all i can see is only you in past from the window of my eyes,

when our future’s existence is taking birth in another universe,

when you smile and i know my si unit of love is only you,

when eyes slightly get moistured with overwhelming memories,

when love is the only thing you long for and give you happiness,

when our every meeting’s grammar is in sync with the syntax of our eternal love,

when all the words and vocabulary is not enough to express our love,

when we are silent and just a cup of coffee together is enough,

when distance does’t matter to love,

when you are here and i am in you…
