Its time <br />
I should sleep<br />
Forget that rainbow<br />
Whose colors<br />
Are becoming dull<br />
But they not fading<br />
From my memory<br />
I see them eveytime<br />
When i close my eyes<br />
I am pitying myself<br />
Because<br />
After swimming<br />
Through all those colors<br />
I am blinded by tearsâ€¦<br />
