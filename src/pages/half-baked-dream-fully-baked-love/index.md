Man chhe maru bhaagi jaay<br />
Maara thi dur<br />
Aa duniya thi dur<br />
Ane tara ma ek thai jaay<br />

(My consciousness doesnâ€™t stay with me,<br />
It runs aways from me<br />
Runs away from this world<br />
And it melts in you and its not mine anymore)<br />

Ek sapnu male taru ane<br />
Aankho ne mari mali jaay<br />
Smit no khajano Nisha<br />
Khyalo varse tara, mara jeevan ma<br />
Ane hu mor bani ne malakai uthu<br />

(These eyes are getting your dreams continuously<br />
They are not asking for anything now<br />
Nisha, It is treasure of smiles<br />
Your thoughts are raining in my life without stopping<br />
And I am like a peacock staying so much happy)<br />

koi aavi ne to puchhe mane kanmani<br />
su joie jeevan ma<br />
ek pal ma aapi dau taru naam<br />
shabdo ae kya nyay karyo chhe mari lagni no<br />
tari vaato ane taari saathe no samay<br />
jeevu chhu roj jem sapna ma<br />
mali ja ne yaar koik divas to vaastvikta ma!<br />

(Kanmani, If someone comes and ask me<br />
what do you want in life<br />
I will give your name without any thoughts<br />
Words never did justice with my feelings<br />
Your talks and time spent with you<br />
I am living that again and again in my dreams<br />
Atleast meet me once like that in reality yaar!)<br />
