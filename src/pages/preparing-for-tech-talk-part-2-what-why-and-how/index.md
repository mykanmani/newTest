kuch questions can never be answered.. <br />
mein tumse kithna pyaar kartha hai?<br />
kuch answers are never ending..<br />
mein aapko kyoon pyaar karoon?<br />
kuch questions have no answer..<br />
kaun tuhje yoon pyaar karega<br />
jaise mein karti hoon?!<br />

love has no rules..<br />
it is right to even fall for the wrong one!<br />
and loving you has no limits..<br />
for it is never enough to stop!<br />
and you.. will never know its depth!!<br />

miles couldn’t distance you from me!<br />
i can still see you with my eyes closed..<br />
and feel you from other end of the world!<br />
your voice is still heard..<br />
and your words echoed!!<br />

some roads lead nowhere..<br />
some stories don’t end well..<br />
yet the journey remains beautiful!<br />
you.. are my journey !!<br />

pages of poems written..<br />
tons of messages sent..<br />
thousands of words spoken..<br />
yet much more love unexpressed!<br />
is that why words can do no justice<br />
to the best things in the world?<br />
love, magic and you!!<br />
