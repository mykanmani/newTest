Ankit!! <br />
A name that my lips are never tired kissing<br />
And my heart never done repeating!<br />
A name that will missed by the heart<br />
But forever remembered in thoughts!!<br />

You are like the Sea!<br />
Mighty and mysterious..<br />
Deep and dark.!<br />
Loud yet silent..<br />
Wild yet resplendent!!<br />

A Man of emotions<br />
You personified Love with grace!<br />
The poems You portrayed on paper<br />
And the colors You painted on me..<br />
Can never be washed away<br />
Even by the Tides of Time!!<br />

I can write a diary with your memories..<br />
A diary that never runs out of pages!<br />
Speaking the language of Love..<br />
And Singing our favorite songs.!<br />
Night, Sky, Shore and Sea..<br />
Music, Poetry, You and Me..!<br />
Those Memories created by moments..<br />
Those moments created with Love!!<br />

I thought Love and Hate were antonyms!<br />
But You taught me..<br />
To Hate with Love<br />
And Love in anger..!<br />
To Smile with year<br />
And Laugh in pain..!<br />
To Hold on when You were not mine..<br />
And never Let go when You will never be mine..!!<br />

Tears are beautiful,<br />
When it rolls out from a Man’s eyes.!<br />
A reflection of pure Love, I saw<br />
In each drop, from Your drenched eyes.!<br />
I wished to Hold You tight<br />
And Heal your soul..<br />
And Caress each scar<br />
Until they hurt no more!!
<br />
To love is Bliss..<br />
To be loved is a Blessing..<br />
Be in Love with You is a Blissful Blessing.!<br />
Like the flowers of colors,<br />
You bloomed in Spring<br />
And withered in Summer.!<br />
But Through every season,<br />
Till the end of Life..<br />
The fragrance You spread,<br />
Will last forever!!<br />

You are my favorite passion<br />
And the sweetest drug.!<br />
A short novel<br />
And a train travel.!<br />
A long drive<br />
And Rahman’s music.!<br />
You are a rainy weather<br />
And a lazy Sunday.!<br />
A special evening<br />
And ‘Death by chocolate’.!<br />
An improptu trip<br />
And a Birthday cake!!<br />

Embracing from Moonlight to Sunrise..<br />
Forgetting the stars of my Sky..<br />
And Kissing the Moon that shined bright.!<br />
Whose breath took away mine..<br />
Passing cold chills down my spine.!<br />
Ankit.. Shall I say something?<br />
We should have stayed in that cave!!<br />
