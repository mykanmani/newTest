There are so many things <br />
Coming and leaving<br />
That something constant is who<br />
I realize very late that its you...<br />

I love you from every part of my body<br />
I failed to understand our relationship<br />
Such a poor fool I am<br />
Who is consumed by memories...<br />

Woods are far behind<br />
And ahead of me is the mountain<br />
How can I climb without you...<br />

I want to ask you take me away from this<br />
Let me sleep on your lap<br />
And forget everything...<br />

Happiness is you and absence of <br />
Everything else that has happened to us...!!<br />
