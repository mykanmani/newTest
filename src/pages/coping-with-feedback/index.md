In the darkness of the night .. <br />
With just moonlight through the windows.. I want to make love to you! <br />
I want to let my hair loose, <br />
look tired and messy.. <br />
I want to wear no makeup.. <br />
And nothing except my smile.. <br />
And my eyes filled with love..!<br />
I want to spend the night in silence..<br />
With unspoken words<br />
And lots of love that only we both understand!!<br />
I want to kiss u goodnight<br />
And wake up remembering the night..<br />
Smiling to myself<br />
And shying away from ur eyes..<br />
Then look at you realising that<br />
We both have now become One!!<br />
