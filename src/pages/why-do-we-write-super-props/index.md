Walking each mile <br />
Holding your hand<br />
With each smile<br />
Wanna stop time-sand<br />

You did a magic on my little heart,<br />
How did you know where to dart,<br />
Ankit you know what!<br />
Ankit shall i say something!<br />
Ankit why are you like this!<br />
Sinamika, your words are in the wind<br />
And with each moment i am losing my mind<br />
We look like dove<br />
True gems of love<br />

Your touch<br />
Your heartbeats<br />
Your that ‘tell’ expression<br />
Your that smiley ‘no’ in my ‘do you love me?’ question!<br />
Everything i inscribed in my heart,<br />
I won’t let anyone to replace it.<br />

Your hairs. Ohh! Like a flow of fresh water<br />
Your shy eyes says everything which you don’t utter..<br />
Your sleep on my shoulder makes me stronger<br />
Your breaths sing songs in my ears<br />
You are gifting me something which i will remember for years..<br />

I wanna kalyanam with you,<br />
Give you all the happiness<br />
That you deserve<br />
My cute little kadhal<br />
Color my world with your laugh<br />
Kanmani just be my better half…!<br />
