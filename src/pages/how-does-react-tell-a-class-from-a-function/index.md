We have certainly came far from where we started. All the joys, tears, fears, love and fights… we are each other’s journey. I want our journey to never end. I love sharing each and everything with you. You renewed my faith in love and actually being able to deeply connect with someone without fear. I am never more at ease then when I’m with you, it’s like talking to myself. I’m very thankful that you are in my life and I want to keep you around if it kills me.

Here is to another big year and many more. Happiee Birthday.
