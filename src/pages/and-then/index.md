And then it happened<br />
Just like how my fear was telling<br />
we dont realise it<br />
until its not possible to stop thinking<br />
and then it strikes<br />
that passion doesn’t mean promises<br />
and love doesn’t mean life time<br />
and then you understand<br />
you have to walk alone<br />
and decorate your soul yourself<br />
cos nobody is coming with flowers<br />
and then you just freeze<br />
cos present is so dull<br />
and future is so dark<br />
hopeless courage is waiting<br />
to ignite the soul<br />
and lit the fire<br />
and then you think<br />
not to hold anything so hard<br />
it will certainly break<br />
and then you learn<br />
stop chasing false dreams<br />
and become a person<br />
you think you can be<br />
with each passing moment<br />
you learn<br />
with each “have a great life ahead”<br />
you learn<br />
