I was died and had lost every part<br />
What did you pour from your heart<br />
O kanmani<br />
My sweet heart<br />
Tell me how do you know this art?<br />

Keep on playing with pen and paper<br />
Keep on writing and reading our names<br />
O kanmani<br />
My only love<br />
Tell me which black magic you did to me?<br />

I am the sea and you are the river<br />
I donâ€™t wanna know from where you started<br />
Through which paths you are flowing<br />
As i know where you gonna get ended<br />
But i pray only one thing every night<br />
O sajna<br />
My half soul<br />
Meet me soon oh my moon<br />
I ll sing n you ll be my tune!<br />
