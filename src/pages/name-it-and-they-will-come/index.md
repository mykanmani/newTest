It’s been so long, <br />
I don’t even know myself,<br />
What I became,<br />
What I am becoming…<br />

Once it was a time that you were with me,<br />
Close to me,<br />
Smelling your hair,<br />
Looking into your tiny little eyes,<br />
Couldn’t resist those vibes,<br />
That Heart is aching without,<br />
Those moments where I was lost in you,<br />
Cursing myself for losing those moments,<br />
Losing you…<br />

Once it was a time that things were simple,<br />
When we were both in love,<br />
When Our silence dint mean anger,<br />
I could steal some time from past and meet you,<br />
I wish I can tell you how sorry I am,<br />
For moments which passed after we apart,<br />
For pain that I dint intend to give,<br />
Cursing myself for deserting those moments,<br />
Deserting you…<br />

It’s been so long,<br />
We don’t even remember from where we start,<br />
What we became,<br />
What we are becoming…<br />
