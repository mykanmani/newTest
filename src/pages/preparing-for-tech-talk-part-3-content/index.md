spoiler: yesterday, we spoke different languages...

yesterday, we spoke different languages <br />
yet conveyed the same meaning <br />
that only we both understood!<br />
today, we speak the same language<br />
but with different meanings<br />
that we both fail to understand!<br />

yesterday, words were filled with silence<br />
yet, your eyes read mine<br />
leaving me nothing more to say!<br />
today, my words did the talking<br />
yet, i wait silently<br />
for you to read between the words!<br />

yesterday, you were so far away<br />
yet so close<br />
to hear what my heart whispered!<br />
today, you are farther away<br />
far than ever<br />
refusing to listen to itâ€™s loud screams!<br />

if only you had listened..<br />
if only you had read..<br />
if only you had understood..<br />
then maybe<br />
today would have remained<br />
the same as yesterday!<br />
just like my love!!<br />
