It just another day
where I miss you badly
and ask myself yet again
do you remember me
I hope you think of me
cos I do more than anything

Wherever I have been and I will be
I want to roam around with you
Do you miss me like that
When you see a beautiful house
and can imagine your dream life
I hope you think of me
cos I just wannna keep looking 
at those assymetrical eyes
where I can live little more

Its been a long time
still it was not enough
time seems to short
when I was happy
when I was with you
Even flowers doesnt stay all seasons
they are just memoir of beauty 
when you see your fingers
I hope you remember me
and how my fingers have been slipped
through them

when the dust will settle down 
and beyond everything
I hope you remember me
whenever someone say
I love you 
and with each word of love
I hope you think of me
cos I think of everything
that we used to be.
