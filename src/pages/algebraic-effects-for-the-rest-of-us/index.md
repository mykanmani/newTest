Jud gya h jo in lamho mein jaise dil mein teri tasveer ki tarah

kaise kate ye gamo ka silsila..

ruth gya hoon mein jaise haqiqaton se

in lamho mein likhte hue karwano se

O yaar! kaise ho gya ye faisla

kaise kate ye tutti hui kwahisho ka silsila…

 

har saaye mein tera saaya

meri har baato mein teri parchaaiya

uthte bikhrte tere pyaar ka awara mein

khoya kaha kaise karu mein bayaa’n,

kaise kate ye bikhrate alfazo ka silsilaa…!!

 

Translation :

Just like your image has bonded with my heart,

this moments has bonded with the sadness which is not going away so easily.

I have distanced myself from all the realities, whatever is being written in this journey…

O dear.. how did this happened.

how can I pass through all these breaking dreams which are continuous..

 

In every shadow, I am seeing your shadow,

In my each talk, there is your reflection.

In your love, this local guy is becoming topsy-turvy,

where am I lost, what will I say..

How can I pass through all these scattering words which are continuous..
