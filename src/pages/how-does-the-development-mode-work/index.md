In this land of goals, <br />

I am empty <br />

What an irony<br />
With feelings and words<br />
I am empty<br />

In dreams sometimes i travel to far away places<br />
That dont exist<br />
To meet a person whom I dont meet regularly<br />

Those happy face sometimes speak<br />
And spill out words which i am longing for<br />

Words of silence and hopeless hope<br />
And my struggle to become the person which you think I am<br />

Burden of memories and how seperated we are<br />
Music without langague and tears without you being near<br />

I am unbearable to myself<br />
How can I tell<br />
How far will my heart let me destroy<br />
Test of my life and love of your lifetimeâ€¦<br />
