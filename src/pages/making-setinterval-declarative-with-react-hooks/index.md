ome names are meaningless, <br />
Some convey a Hundred feelings!<br />
Some names are not unique, some are special!<br />
Some names are simple, some beautiful!<br />
Such names are pronounced Ankit!!<br />

One day to see and smile<br />
One day to laugh and blush!<br />
One day to walk and talk<br />
One day to Love and Live!<br />

When the Sky blended with the Sea<br />
And the Night held its Moon!<br />
When Her eyes looked into His<br />
And His Lips kissed Hers!<br />
When their Hearts conversed<br />
And Souls caressed!!<br />

The silent touches<br />
Whispered the Hidden Love!<br />
While the warm tears<br />
Melted the Frozen pain!<br />
The Eyes spoke louder than words<br />
And the Heart cried for even more!<br />

For once..<br />
Time stood still..<br />
Time had rewinded..<br />
Time changed nothing..!<br />
With Her first Shy with a smile..<br />
His last kiss on Her forehead..<br />
And Their last hug together!<br />
Thatâ€™s How They wrote a story<br />
With an Ending that never Ends!!<br />
