Some evenings are just pain, <br />
Just simple and plain,<br />
Sitting on an unstable chair,<br />
Thoughts of unexpressed love to you in the air,<br />
And you know<br />
I hate sitting in front of a blank page with a blanker expression.<br />
So this is what i’ll do: i’m going to fill it up with you.<br />
Yes, you.<br />
The one with a smile waiting to invade my face.<br />
You are beautiful. And you know it.<br />
Who are you?<br />
A girl with assymetric eyes<br />
Or  girl with soothing voice<br />
It’s you, just.  <br />
You look through stuff—<br />
Exquisitely.<br />
Maybe because you sleep less and see more?  <br />
There’s charm in almost everything you do.<br />
Even the way you move your hands on my body.<br />
Even the way you kiss my lips.<br />
Even while sitting quietly on the corner of a bed. <br />
Or talking with your mouth full of cheese. <br />
You’ve become my favourite; <br />
Person, colour and  word. <br />
Effortlessly. <br />
I can’t be mistaken on certain things.<br />
You are one of them.<br />
Aren’t you something?<br />
Which is why i’m always in hangover of you.<br />
I am done with the distance we are keeping,<br />
Forget it for some time.<br />
Unfortunately, you are not forgetting the distance,<br />
And not letting me write a stories on your skin<br />
Fortunately, you don’t know how to swim hence<br />
You can only sink further into me.<br />
For good or for worse, i won’t be empty anymore. <br />
You will complete me.<br />
