You are unique beautiful soul<br />
Don’t listen to others<br />
They are just crowd<br />
Your voice is a song in itself<br />
Your gaze has a story of her own<br />
You are wonderful as you are<br />
Far more than just what the word ‘unique’ has to say<br />

Fresh like a morning and angry bird<br />
How everything you handle has a charm in itself<br />
A piece of love in everything you do<br />
How restless it would be for someone like me<br />
to unable see you while you are asleep<br />
and wake you up next to you<br />

This world with so many distractions<br />
I want to write you as my permenent address<br />
As cheesy as it sounds<br />
It is ultimately I want<br />
Memories are flooded while writing this<br />
I am in awe of you and always be your “Ankit You know what!”<br />

I did not know the meaning of nostalgia before you<br />
I have never longed to hear ‘Ankit’ from anyone else<br />
I am lost but I know you are my path<br />
I dont know who am I but I know you are my kanmani<br />

Happy Birthday, Love!<br />
