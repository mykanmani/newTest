Your voice is like a cold breeze..

Each time it makes me freeze!

Without making me special..

You are making me special!

That buzz word called love..

Travelling beyond and above..

Longing to talk again and again..

Lets ask our hearts to bargain!

A short time and lets make it lazy..

Let love drive ourselves crazy..

Promise you this wont be hazy..

But dont ever say odipo baby!!

From here to write i begin..

To tell you all that i had within!

Not knowing where exactly to start..

But knowing that you wont go apart!!

I know not what brought us together..

But it is love that takes us farther..

For every time i hear your voice..

My heart tells me that your my choice!

Longing to see my darling smile..

Waiting to travel a hundred mile..

Dreaming to hold his hands with mine..

Wanting him to become all mine..!

I pack my bags counting each day

To enjoy my turn of bangalore days!

To forget all the stars of my sky..

And to remember the only moon of my night..!

I come there to remind you this sweet heart..

That i always love you from the bottom of my heart!!
