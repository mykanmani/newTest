From your simple smiles to loud laughs <br />
From your little secrets to biggest dreams<br />
I loved you with al my heart forever!<br />
As the waves long to meet the shore<br />
As the rivers long to meet the sea<br />
I longed to see you each day forever!<br />
In every song we heard together<br />
In every line we sang for each other<br />
I ll hear your voice louder than the singer forever!<br />
With the wound of love that never heals<br />
With the pain of being forgotten that always hurts<br />
You ll remain in my thoughts forever!<br />
Between the dull grey clouds<br />
Between the deep dark woods<br />
Will stay hidden those words i wished to hear forever!<br />
Like the night that waited for the moon on a new moon day<br />
Like the sky that waited to meet the sea at horizon<br />
I kept waiting for a love that I never received forever!<br />
